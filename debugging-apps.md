## Lab2 - Debugging Applications

In this lab, you will debug the coolstore application using Java remote debugging and 
look into line-by-line code execution as the code runs on Quarkus.

####1. Enable Remote Debugging

---

Remote debugging is a useful debugging technique for application development which allows 
looking into the code that is being executed somewhere else on a different machine and 
execute the code line-by-line to help investigate bugs and issues. Remote debugging is 
part of  Java SE standard debugging architecture which you can learn more about it in [Java SE docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/architecture.html).

Quarkus in development mode enables hot deployment with background compilation, 
which means that when you modify your Java files and/or your resource files and refresh your browser, 
these changes will automatically take effect. This works too for resource files like the configuration property file. 

This will also listen for a debugger on port 5005. If your want to wait for the debugger to attach before 
running you can pass -Ddebug on the command line. If you donâ€™t want the debugger at all you can use -Ddebug=false.

An easier approach would be to use the Quarkus maven plugin to enable remote debugging on 
the Inventory pod. It also forwards the default remote debugging port, 5005, from the 
Inventory pod to your workstation so simplify connectivity.

Enable remote debugging on Inventory by running the following inside the `inventory` 
directory in the CodeReady Workspace **Terminal** window:

`mvn compile quarkus:dev`

> The default port for remoting debugging is `5005` but you can change the default port 

You are all set now to start debugging using the tools of you choice. 

Do not wait for the command to return! The fabric8 maven plugin keeps the forwarded 
port open so that you can start debugging remotely.

####2. Remote Debug with CodeReady Workspace

---

CodeReady Workspace provides a convenience way to remotely connect to Java applications running 
inside containers and debug while following the code execution in the IDE.

From the **Run** menu, click on **Edit Debug Configurations...**.

![Remote Debug]({% image_path debug-che-debug-config-1.png %})

The window shows the debuggers available in CodeReady Workspace. Click on the plus sign near the 
Java debugger.

![Remote Debug]({% image_path debug-che-debug-config-2.png %})

Configure the remote debugger and click on the **Save** button:

* Check **Connect to process on workspace machine**
* Port: `5005`

![Remote Debug]({% image_path debug-che-debug-config-3.png %}

You can now click on the **Debug** button to make CodeReady Workspace connect to the 
Inventory service running on OpenShift.

You should see a confirmation that the remote debugger is successfully connected.

![Remote Debug]({% image_path debug-che-debug-config-4.png %}){:width="700px"}

Open `com.redhat.coolstore.InventoryResource` and double-click 
on the editor sidebar on the line number of the first line of the `getAvailability()` 
method to add a breakpoint to that line. A start appears near the line to show a breakpoint 
is set.

![Add Breakpoint]({% image_path debug-che-breakpoint.png %})

Open a new **Terminal** window and use `curl` to invoke the Inventory API with the 
suspect product id in order to pause the code execution at the defined breakpoint.

Note that you can use the the following icons to switch between debug and terminal windows.

![Icons]({% image_path debug-che-window-guide.png %})

Invoke the endpoint URL of the Inventory service using `curl` command:

`curl http://localhost:8080/services/inventory/165613 ; echo`

Switch back to the debug panel and notice that the code execution is paused at the 
breakpoint on `InventoryResource` class.

![Icons]({% image_path debug-che-breakpoint-stop.png %})

Click on the _Step Over_ icon to execute one line and retrieve the inventory object for the 
given product id from the database.

![Step Over]({% image_path debug-che-step-over.png %}){:width="700px"}

Click on the the plus icon in the **Variables** panel to add the `inventory` variable 
to the list of watch variables.

![Debug]({% image_path debug-che-breakpoint-values.png %})

This would allow you to see the value of `inventory` variable during execution.

![Watch Variables]({% image_path debug-che-variables.png %})

Look at the **Variables** window. The retrieved inventory object is `serialPersistentFields`!

The product id(**165613**) is a unique value to retrieve certain data from the Inventory database. 
If you might have unexpected result or errors in development, this debugging feature will help you find 
the root cause quickly then you will eventually fix the issue.

####3. Resume Debug and Confirm the Result

Click on the _Resume_ icon to continue the code execution and then on the stop icon to 
end the debug session. When you swich to **Terminal-2** window, you will see the result of `curl` command.

~~~shell
[{"id":3,"itemId":"165613","link":"http://maps.google.com/?q=Seoul","location":"Seoul","quantity":256}]
~~~

![Icons]({% image_path debug-che-window-result.png %})

> **NOTE**: Make sure to stop Quarkus development mode via `Close` the terminal.

#####Congratulations!
