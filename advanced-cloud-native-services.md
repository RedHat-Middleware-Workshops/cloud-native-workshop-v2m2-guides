## Advanced Cloud-Native Services

If you complete the **Cloud Native Workshop - Module 1**, you learned how to take an existing application to the cloud with JBoss EAP and OpenShift,
and you got a glimpse into the power of OpenShift for existing applications.

In this lab, you will go deeper into how to use the OpenShift Container Platform as a developer to build and deploy applications. We'll focus on the core features of OpenShift as it relates to developers, and you'll learn typical workflows for a developer (develop, build, test, deploy, and repeat).

#### Let's get started

---

If you are not familiar with the OpenShift Container Platform, it's worth taking a few minutes to understand the basics of the platform as well as the environment that you will be using for this workshop.

The goal of OpenShift is to provide a great experience for both Developers and System Administrators to develop, deploy, and run containerized applications.  Developers should love using OpenShift because it enables them to take advantage of both containerized applications and orchestration without having the know the details.  Developers are free to focus on their code instead of spending time writing Dockerfiles and running docker builds.

Both Developers and Operators communicate with the OpenShift Platform via one of the following methods:

* **Command Line Interface** - The command line tool that we will be using as part of this training is called the *oc* tool. You used this briefly in the last lab. This tool is written in the Go programming language and is a single executable that is provided for Windows, OS X, and the Linux Operating Systems.
* **Web Console** -  OpenShift also provides a feature rich Web Console that provides a friendly graphical interface for interacting with the platform. You can always access the Web Console using the link provided just above the Terminal window on the right:
* **REST API** - Both the command line tool and the web console actually communicate to OpenShift via the same method, the REST API.  Having a robust API allows users to create their own scripts and automation depending on their specific requirements.  For detailed information about the REST API, check out the [official documentation](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/rest_api/index.html){:target="_blank"}. You will not use the REST API directly in this workshop.

During this workshop, you will be using both the command line tool and the web console.  However, it should be noted that there are plugins for several integrated development environments as well. For example, to use OpenShift from the Eclipse IDE, you would want to use the official [JBoss Tools](https://tools.jboss.org/features/openshift.html){:target="_blank"} plugin.

Now that you know how to interact with OpenShift, let's focus on some core concepts that you as a developer will need to understand as you are building your applications!

#### Developer Concepts

---

There are several concepts in OpenShift useful for developers, and in this workshop you should be familiar with them.

##### Projects

[Projects](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#projects) are a top level concept to help you organize your deployments. An OpenShift project allows a community of users (or a user) to organize and manage their content in isolation from other communities. Each project has its own resources, policies (who can or cannot perform actions), and constraints (quotas and limits on resources, etc). Projects act as a wrapper around all the
application services and endpoints you (or your teams) are using for your work.

##### Containers

The basic units of OpenShift applications are called containers (sometimes called Linux Containers). [Linux container technologies](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1353593){:target="_blank"} are lightweight mechanisms for isolating running processes so that they are limited to interacting with only their designated resources.

Though you do not directly interact with the Docker CLI or service when using OpenShift Container Platform, understanding their capabilities and terminology is important for understanding their role in OpenShift Container Platform and how your applications function inside of containers.

##### Pods

OpenShift Container Platform leverages the Kubernetes concept of a pod, which is one or more containers deployed together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined, deployed, and managed.

Pods are the rough equivalent of a machine instance (physical or virtual) to a container. Each pod is allocated its own internal IP address, therefore owning its entire port space, and containers within pods can share their local storage and networking.

##### Images

Containers in OpenShift are based on Docker-formatted container images. An image is a binary that includes all of the requirements for running a single container,
as well as metadata describing its needs and capabilities.

You can think of it as a packaging technology. Containers only have access to resources defined in the image unless you give the container additional access when creating it. By deploying the same image in multiple containers across multiple hosts and load balancing between them, OpenShift Container Platform can provide redundancy and horizontal scaling for a service packaged into an image.

##### Image Streams

An image stream and its associated tags provide an abstraction for referencing Images from within OpenShift. The image stream and its tags allow you to see what images are available and ensure that you are using the specific image you need even if the image in the repository changes.

##### Builds

A build is the process of transforming input parameters into a resulting object. Most often, the process is used to transform input parameters or source code into a runnable image. A _BuildConfig_ object is the definition of the entire build process. It can build from different sources, including a Dockerfile, a source code repository like Git, or a Jenkins Pipeline definition.

##### Pipelines

Pipelines allow developers to define a _Jenkins_ pipeline for execution by the Jenkins pipeline plugin. The build can be started, monitored, and managed by OpenShift Container Platform in the same way as any other build type.

Pipeline workflows are defined in a Jenkinsfile, either embedded directly in the build configuration, or supplied in a Git repository and referenced by the build configuration.

##### Deployments

An OpenShift Deployment describes how images are deployed to pods, and how the pods are deployed to the underlying container runtime platform. OpenShift deployments also provide the ability to transition from an existing deployment of an image to a new one and also define hooks to be run before or after creating the replication controller.

##### Services

A Kubernetes service serves as an internal load balancer. It identifies a set of replicated pods in order to proxy the connections it receives to them. Backing pods can be added to or removed from a service arbitrarily while the service remains consistently available, enabling anything that depends on the service to refer to it at a consistent address.

##### Routes

_Services_ provide internal abstraction and load balancing within an OpenShift environment, sometimes clients (users, systems, devices, etc.) **outside** of OpenShift need to access an application. The way that external clients are able to access applications running in OpenShift is through the OpenShift routing layer. And the data object behind that is a _Route_.

The default OpenShift router (HAProxy) uses the HTTP header of the incoming request to determine where to proxy the connection. You can optionally define security, such as TLS, for the _Route_. If you want your _Services_, and, by extension, your _Pods_,  to be accessible to the outside world, you need to create a _Route_.

##### Templates

Templates contain a collection of object definitions (BuildConfigs, DeploymentConfigs, Services, Routes, etc) that compose an entire working project. They are useful for packaging up an entire collection of runtime objects into a somewhat portable representation of a running application, including the configuration of the elements.

You will use several pre-defined templates to initialize different environments for the application. You've already used one in the previous lab to deploy the application
into a _dev_ environment, and you'll use more in this lab to provision the _production_ environment as well.

Consult the [OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com){:target="_blank"} for more details on these and other concepts.

#### Getting Ready for the labs

> **NOTE**
>
> If you've already completed the **Optimizing Existing Applications** module then you will simply need to import the code for this module. Skip down to the **Import Projects** section.

---

##### If this is the first module you are doing today

You will be using Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces, an online IDE based on [Eclipe Che](https://www.eclipse.org/che/){:target="_blank"}{:target="_blank"}. **Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds**, so you don't need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, [access the Che instance]({{ ECLIPSE_CHE_URL }}){:target="_blank"} and log in using the username and password you've been assigned (e.g. `{{ CHE_USER_NAME }}/{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`):

![cdw]({% image_path che-login.png %})

Once you log in, you'll be placed on your personal dashboard. We've pre-created workspaces for you to use. Click on the name of the pre-created workspace on the left, as shown below (the name will be different depending on your assigned number). You can also click on the name of the workspace in the center, and then click on the green button that says "OPEN" on the top right hand side of the screen:

![cdw]({% image_path che-precreated.png %})

After a minute or two, you'll be placed in the workspace:

![cdw]({% image_path che-workspace.png %})

To gain extra screen space, click on the yellow arrow to hide the left menu (you won't need it):

![cdw]({% image_path che-realestate.png %})

Users of Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code will see a familiar layout: a project/file browser on the left, a code editor on the right, and a terminal at the bottom. You'll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. **If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.**

##### Import Projects

Click on the **Import Projects...** in **Workspace** menu and enter the following:

![codeready-workspace-import]({% image_path codeready-workspace-menu.png %})

> NOTE: If you've completed other modules already, then you can use _Workspace > Import Project_ menu to import the project.

  * Version Control System: `GIT`
  * URL: `{{GIT_URL}}/userXX/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs.git`(IMPORTANT: replace userXX with your lab user)
  * Check `Import recursively (for multi-module projects)`
  * Name: `cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs`

**Tip**: You can find GIT URL when you click on [GIT URL]({{GIT_URL}}){:target="_blank"} then login with your credentials.

![codeready-workspace-import]({% image_path codeready-workspace-import.png %}){:width="700px"}

The projects are imported now into your workspace and is visible in the project explorer.

CodeReady Workspaces is a full featured IDE and provides language specific capabilities for various project types. In order to
enable these capabilities, let's convert the imported project skeletons to a Maven projects. In the project explorer, right-click on each project (`monolith`, `inventory` and `catalog`) and
then click on `Convert to Project` continuously.

> **NOTE**
>
> If you do not see the `Convert to Project` then your projects are already converted, and you should see a small icon next to each project:
> ![codeready-workspace-convert]({% image_path maven-icon.png %}){:width="600px"}

If not, then convert them:

![codeready-workspace-convert]({% image_path codeready-workspace-convert.png %}){:width="500px"}

Choose `Maven` from the project configurations and then click on `Save`.

![codeready-workspace-maven]({% image_path codeready-workspace-maven.png %}){:width="700px"}

Repeat the above for all 3 projects (`monolith`, `inventory` and `catalog` projects.)

> `NOTE`: For the rest of these labs, anytime you need to run a command in a terminal, you can use the CodeReady Workspaces Terminal window.

![codeready-workspace-terminal]({% image_path codeready-workspace-terminal.png %})

#### Login to OpenShift CLI

Although your Eclipse Che workspace is running on the Kubernetes cluster, it's running with a default restricted _Service Account_ that prevents you from creating most resource types. If you've completed other modules, you're probably already logged in, but let's login again: open a Terminal and issue the following command:

`oc login https://$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST:$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true`

Enter your username and password assigned to you:

* Username: `userXX`
* Password: `r3dh4t1!`

You should see like:

~~~shell
Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * default
    istio-system
    user0-bookinfo
    user0-catalog
    user0-cloudnative-pipeline
    user0-cloudnativeapps
    user0-inventory

Using project "default".
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
~~~

##### If this is the first module you are doing today

If you've already completed Module 1 (Optimizing Existing Applications), then you will already have the _CoolStore_ app deployed.

**If this is the first module you are completing today, you need to deploy CoolStore monolith application by running this command in a CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:**

`sh /projects/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs/monolith/scripts/deploy-inventory.sh userXX`

`sh /projects/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs/monolith/scripts/deploy-catalog.sh userXX`

`sh /projects/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs/monolith/scripts/deploy-coolstore.sh userXX`

> NOTE: Replace `userXX` with your actual username!

Wait for the commands to complete. If you see any errors, contact an instructor!

#### Verifying the Dev Environment

---

In the previous module, you created a new OpenShift project called **userXX-coolstore-dev** which represents your developer personal project in which you deployed the CoolStore monolith.

##### Verify Application

Let's take a moment and review the OpenShift resources that are created for the Monolith:

* Build Config: **coolstore** build config is the configuration for building the Monolith image from the source code or WAR file
* Image Stream: **coolstore** image stream is the virtual view of all coolstore container images built and pushed to the OpenShift integrated registry.
* Deployment Config: **coolstore** deployment config deploys and redeploys the Coolstore container image whenever a new coolstore container image becomes available. Similarly, the **coolstore-postgresql** does the same for the database.
* Service: **coolstore** and **coolstore-postgresql** service is an internal load balancer which identifies a set of pods (containers) in order to proxy the connections it receives to them. Backing pods can be added to or removed from a service arbitrarily while the service remains consistently available, enabling anything that depends on the service to refer to it at a consistent address (service name or IP).
* Route: **www** route registers the service on the built-in external load-balancer and assigns a public DNS name to it so that it can be reached from outside OpenShift cluster.

You can review the above resources in the [OpenShift web console]({{ CONSOLE_URL}}){:target="_blank"} or using the _oc get_ or _oc describe_ commands (oc describe gives more detailed info):

> You can use short synonyms for long words, like **bc** instead of **buildconfig**, **is** for **imagestream**, **dc** for **deploymentconfig**, **svc** for **service**, etc.

> NOTE: Don't worry about reading and understanding the output of oc describe. Just make sure the command doesn't report errors!

Set the current project to _coolstore_ and replace your username with **userXX**:

`oc project userXX-coolstore-dev`

Run these commands to inspect the elements via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal window:

`oc get bc coolstore`

`oc get is coolstore`

`oc get dc coolstore`

`oc get svc coolstore`

`oc describe route www`

Verify that you can access the monolith by clicking on the exposed OpenShift route to open up the sample application in a separate browser tab.

You should also be able to see both the CoolStore monolith and its database running in separate pods via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal window:

`oc get pods -l application=coolstore`

The output should look like this:

~~~shell
NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
coolstore-2-bpkkc              1/1       Running   0          4m
coolstore-postgresql-1-jpcb8   1/1       Running   0          9m
~~~

#### Verify Database

---

You can log into the running Postgres container using the following via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal window:

`oc  rsh dc/coolstore-postgresql`

Once logged in, use the following command to execute an SQL statement to show some content from the database:

`psql -U $POSTGRESQL_USER $POSTGRESQL_DATABASE -c 'select name from PRODUCT_CATALOG;'`

You should see the following:

~~~
          name
------------------------
 Red Fedora
 Forge Laptop Sticker
 Solid Performance Polo
 Ogio Caliber Polo
 16 oz. Vortex Tumbler
 Atari 2600 Joystick
 Pebble Smart Watch
 Oculus Rift
 Lytro Camera
(9 rows)
~~~

Don't forget to exit the pod's shell with **exit**.

With our running project on OpenShift, in the next step we'll explore how you as a developer can work with the running app to make changes and debug the application!
