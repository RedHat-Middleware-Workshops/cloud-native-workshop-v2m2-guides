= Lab1 - Automating Deployments Using Pipelines
:experimental:

In the previous scenarios, you deployed the Coolstore monolith using an OpenShift Template into the *{{USER_ID}}-coolstore-dev* Project. The template created the necessary objects (BuildConfig, DeploymentConfig, ImageStreams, Services, and Routes) and gave you as a Developer a playground in which to run the app, make changes and debug.

In this step, we are now going to setup a separate production environment and explore some best practices and techniques for developers and DevOps teams for getting code from the developer *(that’s YOU!)* to production with less downtime and greater consistency.

=== Production vs. Development

The existing *{{USER_ID}}-coolstore-dev* project is used as a developer environment for building new versions of the app after code changes and deploying them to the development environment.

In a real project on OpenShift, _dev_, _test_ and _production_ environments would typically use different OpenShift projects and perhaps even different OpenShift clusters.

For simplicity in this scenario we will only use a _dev_ and _prod_ environment, and no test/QA environment.

==== 1. Create the production environment

Back in the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-coolstore-dev[Topology View^], click on the project drop-down and select *Create Project*.

image::create_project.png[create_dialog, 600]

Fill in the fields, and click `Create`:

* Name: *{{USER_ID}}-coolstore-prod*
* Display Name: *{{USER_ID}} Coolstore Monolith - Production*
* Description: _leave this field empty_

[WARNING]
====
YOU `MUST` USE `{{USER_ID}}-coolstore-prod` AS THE PROJECT NAME, as this name is referenced later on and you will experience failures if you do not name it `{{USER_ID}}-coolstore-prod`.
====

This will create a new OpenShift project called *{{USER_ID}}-coolstore-prod* from which our production application will run.

==== 2. Add the production elements

In this case we’ll use the production template to create the objects.

We've pre-installed an application _template_ for use. Click the *+Add* and then *From Catalog* item:

image::from_catalog.png[create_new, 700]

In the search box, type in `coolstore` and choose _Coolstore Monolith using pipelines_ and then click *Instantiate Template*.

image::from_catalog_prod.png[create_new, 700]

Fill in the following fields:

* *Namespace*: `{{ USER_ID }}-coolstore-prod` (this should already be selected)
* *User ID*: `{{ USER_ID }}`

image::from_catalog_prod_details.png[create_new, 700]

Keep the other values as-is and scroll down and click *Create*.

Go to the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-coolstore-prod[Topology View^] to see the elements that were deployed.

The *Topology* view in the _Developer_ perspective of the web console provides a visual representation of all the applications within a project, their build status, and the components and services associated with them.

Label the components so that they get proper icons by running this command in the CodeReady Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc project {{USER_ID}}-coolstore-prod && \
oc label dc/coolstore-prod-postgresql app.openshift.io/runtime=postgresql --overwrite && \
oc label dc/coolstore-prod app.openshift.io/runtime=jboss --overwrite && \
oc label dc/coolstore-prod-postgresql app.kubernetes.io/part-of=coolstore-prod --overwrite && \
oc label dc/coolstore-prod app.kubernetes.io/part-of=coolstore-prod --overwrite && \
oc annotate dc/coolstore-prod app.openshift.io/connects-to=coolstore-prod-postgresql --overwrite && \
oc annotate dc/coolstore-prod app.openshift.io/vcs-uri=https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs.git --overwrite && \
oc annotate dc/coolstore-prod app.openshift.io/vcs-ref=ocp-4.3 --overwrite
----

image::coolstore_topology.png[create_new, 700]

You can see the _postgres_ database running (with a dark blue circle), and the coolstore monolith, which has not yet been deployed or started. In previous labs we deployed manually from a binary build of our app in our developer project. In this lab we will use a _CI/CD pipeline_ to build and deploy automatically go our production environment.

We will use a *Jenkins Server* in our project and  use a _Jenkins Pipeline_ build strategy.

Click *Add* then click *From Catalog*, type in `jenkins` in the search box, and choose the FIRST *Jenkins (ephemeral)* item:

image::from_catalog_jenkins.png[create_new, 700]

Click *Instantiate Template* and change the following fields, leaving other fields alone:

* *Namespace*: `{{ USER_ID }}-coolstore-prod` (this should already be selected)
* *Memory Limit*: `2Gi`
* *Disable memory intensive administrative monitors*: `true`

Click *Create*.

Let's label the new Jenkins server:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc label dc/jenkins app.openshift.io/runtime=jenkins --overwrite
----

Back on the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-coolstore-prod[Topology View^] you can see the production database, and an application called Jenkins which OpenShift uses to manage CI/CD pipeline deployments.

image::coolstore_prod_jenkins.png[create_new, 700]

There is no running production app just yet. The only running app is back in the _dev_ environment, where you used a binary build to run the app previously.

In the next step, we’ll _promote_ the app from the _dev_ environment to the _production_ environment using an OpenShift pipeline build. Let’s get going!

=== Promoting Apps Across Environments with Pipelines

So far you have built and deployed the app manually to OpenShift in the _dev_ environment. Although it’s convenient for local development, it’s an error-prone way of delivering software when extended to test and production environments.

*Continuous Delivery (CD)* refers to a set of practices with the intention of automating various aspects of delivery software. One of these practices is called delivery pipeline which is an automated process to define the steps a change in code or configuration has to go through in order to reach upper environments and eventually to production.

OpenShift simplifies building CI/CD Pipelines by integrating the popular https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/overview/[Jenkins pipelines^] into the platform and enables defining truly complex workflows directly from within OpenShift. OpenShift 4 also introduces https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/pipelines[Tekton Pipelines^], an evolution of CI/CD for Kubernetes, which you might be exploring in a later module if it's on the agenda for today.

The first step for any deployment pipeline is to store all code and configurations in a source code repository. In this workshop, the source code and configurations are stored in a https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs[GitHub repository^] we’ve been
using.

OpenShift has built-in support for *Jenkins CI/CD pipelines* by allowing developers to define a https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/[Jenkins pipeline^] for execution by a Jenkins automation engine.

The build can get started, monitored, and managed by OpenShift in the same way as any other build types e.g. S2I. Pipeline workflows are defined in a `Jenkinsfile`, either embedded directly in the build configuration, or supplied in Git repository and referenced by the build configuration. They are written using the http://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy scripting language].

As part of the production environment template you used in the last step, a Pipeline build object was created. Ordinarily the pipeline would contain steps to build the project in the _dev_ environment, store the resulting image in the local repository, run the image and execute tests against it, then wait for human approval to _promote_ the resulting image to other environments like test or production.

==== 3. Inspect the Pipeline Definition

[NOTE]
====
You may notice a _Pipelines_ menu item on the left menu of the OpenShift Console. This menu item is for exploring _Tekton Pipelines_, which is a newer pipeline technology based on the Tekton project. There are other modules as part of this workshop that explore Tekton. For now we'll concentrate on Jenkins.
====

Our pipeline is somewhat simplified for the purposes of this Workshop. Inspect the contents of the pipeline by navigating to the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/k8s/ns/{{USER_ID}}-coolstore-prod/buildconfigs[Build Config page^] and click on `monolith-pipeline`:

image::prod_bc.png[create_new, 700]

Then, you will see the details of _Jenkinsfile_ on the right side:

image::coolstore-prod-monolith-bc.png[monolith-pipeline, 700]

You can also inspect this via the following command via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal window:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc describe bc/monolith-pipeline -n {{USER_ID}}-coolstore-prod
----

The pipeline syntax allows creating complex deployment scenarios with the possibility of defining checkpoints for manual interaction and approval processes using https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/[the large set of steps and plugins that Jenkins provides] in order to adapt the pipeline to the processes used in your team.

To simplify the pipeline in this workshop, we simulate the build and tests and skip any need for human input. Once the pipeline completes, it deploys the app from the _dev_ environment to our _production_ environment using the above `tag()` method within the `openshift` object, which simply re-tags the image you already created using a tag which will trigger deployment in the production environment.

==== 4. Promote the dev image to production using the pipeline

Let’s invoke the build pipeline.

On the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/k8s/ns/{{USER_ID}}-coolstore-prod/buildconfigs/monolith-pipeline[Pipeline Details Page^], select _Actions > Start Build_:

image::pipe-start.png[Prod, 700]

This will start the pipeline. _It will take a minute or two to start the pipeline!_ Future runs will not take as much time as the Jenkins infrastructure will already be warmed up. You can watch the progress of the pipeline:

image::pipe-prog.png[Prod, 700]

Once the pipeline completes, return to the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-coolstore-prod[Topology View^] and notice that the application is now deployed and running!

image::pipe-done.png[Prod, 700]

It may take a few moments for the container to deploy fully.

*Congratulations!* You have successfully setup a development and production environment for your project and can use this workflow for future projects as well.

In the next step, we’ll add a human interaction element to the pipeline, so that you as a project lead can be in charge of approving changes.

==== 5. Adding Pipeline Approval Steps

In previous steps, you used an OpenShift Pipeline to automate the process of building and deploying changes from the dev environment to production. In this step, we’ll add a final checkpoint to the pipeline which will require you as the project lead to approve the final push to production.

Ordinarily your pipeline definition would be checked into a source code management system like Git, and to change the pipeline you’d edit the _Jenkinsfile_ in the source base. For this workshop we’ll just edit it directly to add the necessary changes. You can edit it with the *oc* command but we’ll use the Web Console.

Back on the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/k8s/ns/{{USER_ID}}-coolstore-prod/buildconfigs/monolith-pipeline[Pipeline Details Page^] click on the *YAML* tab. Add _a new stage_ to the pipeline, just before the _Deploy to PROD_ stage:

[NOTE]
====
You will need to copy and paste the below code into the right place of *BuildConfig* as shown in the below image.
====

[source,groovy, role="copypaste"]
----
            stage ('Approve Go Live') {
              steps {
                timeout(time:30, unit:'MINUTES') {
                  input message:'Go Live in Production (switch to new version)?'
                }
              }
            }
----

Your final pipeline should look like:

image::pipe-edit2.png[Prod, 700]

Click *Save*.

==== 6. Make a simple change to the app

With the approval step in place, let’s simulate a new change from a developer who wants to change the color of the header in the coolstore to a blue background color.

First, in CodeReady, in the `cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs` project, open _monolith/src/main/webapp/app/css/coolstore.css_, which contains the CSS stylesheet for the
CoolStore app.

Add the following CSS to turn the header bar background to Blue (*Copy* to add it at the bottom):

[source,css, role="copypaste"]
----
.navbar-header {
    background: blue
}
----

Now we need to update the catalog endpoint in the monolith application. Run the following commands in a Terminal to update the baseUrl to the proper value with your username:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
JSPATH="$CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs/monolith/src/main/webapp/app/services/catalog.js"
CATALOGHOST=$(oc get route -n {{ USER_ID}}-catalog catalog-springboot -o jsonpath={% raw %}"{.spec.host}"{% endraw %})
sed -i 's/REPLACEURL/'$CATALOGHOST'/' "$JSPATH"
----

Next, re-build the app once more via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn clean package -Popenshift -DskipTests -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs/monolith
----

And re-deploy it to the *dev* environment using a binary build just as we did before via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc start-build -n {{USER_ID}}-coolstore-dev coolstore --from-file=$CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs/monolith/deployments/ROOT.war --follow
----
Wait for it to complete the deployment via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc -n {{USER_ID}}-coolstore-dev rollout status -w dc/coolstore
----

And verify that the blue header is visible in the *dev* application by navigating to the http://www-{{USER_ID}}-coolstore-dev.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}[Coolstore Dev Web frontend^]. It should look like the following:

[WARNING]
====
If it doesn’t, you may need to do a hard browser refresh. Try holding the shift key while clicking the browser refresh button, or opening a separate "Private Browser" session to access the UI.
====

image::nav-blue.png[Dev, 700]

Confirm the http://www-{{USER_ID}}-coolstore-prod.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}[Coolstore Prod Web frontend^] is still using the original black header:

image::pipe-orig.png[Prod, 700]

We’re happy with this change in *dev*, so let’s promote the new change to *prod*, using the new approval step!

==== 7. Run the pipeline again

Invoke the pipeline once more by navigating to the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/k8s/ns/{{USER_ID}}-coolstore-prod/buildconfigs/monolith-pipeline[Pipeline Details Page^], select _Actions > Start Build_.

The same pipeline progress will be shown, however before deploying to prod, you will see a prompt in the pipeline:

image::pipe-start2.png[Prod, 700]

Click on the link for *Input Required*. This will open a new tab and direct you to Jenkins itself, where you can login with the same credentials as OpenShift:

* Username: `{{USER_ID}}`
* Password: `{{OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD}}`

Accept the browser certificate warning and the Jenkins/OpenShift permissions, and then you’ll find yourself at the approval prompt:

Click on *Console Output* on left menu then click on `Proceed`.

image::pipe-jenkins-prompt.png[Prod, 700]

=== 8. Approve the change to go live

Click *Proceed*, which will approve the change to be pushed to production. You could also have clicked *Abort* which would stop the pipeline immediately in case the change was unwanted or unapproved.

Once you click _Proceed_, you will see the log file from Jenkins showing the final progress and deployment.

On the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-coolstore-prod[Production Topology View^], wait for the production deployment to complete (and you get all blue circles!).

Once it completes, verify that the http://www-{{USER_ID}}-coolstore-prod.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}[Coolstore Prod Web frontend^] has the new change (blue header):

image::nav-blue.png[Prod, 700]

[WARNING]
====
It may take a few seconds for the new app to be available, since we've not configured a proper health check and are not using _Rolling Updates_ when deploying new apps. Real production environments would use this to ensure no downtime.

If you don't see a blue header, or you get _Application Not Available_ errors, wait a few moments and reload. If you are still getting a black header, try holding the shift key while clicking the browser refresh button to force a hard refresh.
====

Congratulations! You have added a human approval step for all future developer changes. You now have two projects that can be
visualized as:

image::goal.png[Prod, 700]

=== Summary


In this lab, you learned how to use the OpenShift Container Platform as a developer to build, and deploy applications. You also learned how OpenShift makes your life easier as a developer, architect, and DevOps engineer.

You can use these techniques in future projects to modernize your existing applications and add a lot of functionality without major re-writes.

The monolithic application we’ve been using so far works great, but is starting to show its age. Even small changes to one part of the app require many teams to be involved in the push to production.
