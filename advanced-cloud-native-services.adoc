= Advanced Cloud-Native Services
:experimental:

If you completed the *Cloud Native Workshop - Module 1*, you learned how to take an existing application to the cloud with JBoss EAP and OpenShift, and you got a glimpse into the power of OpenShift for modernizing existing applications with microservices. If you did not, or you started but didn't finish, there are scripts below you can run to catch up.

In this lab, you will go deeper into how to use the OpenShift Container Platform as a developer to build and deploy applications. We’ll focus on the core features of OpenShift as it relates to developers, and you’ll learn typical workflows for a developer (develop, build, test, deploy, and repeat).

=== Getting Ready for the labs

[WARNING]
====
If you’ve already completed the *Optimizing Existing Applications* module then you will simply need to import the code for this module. Skip down to the *Import Projects* section.
====

You will be using Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces, an online IDE based on https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^]. *Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds*, so you don’t need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {{ ECLIPSE_CHE_URL }}[access the CodeReady Workspaces instance^] and log in using the username and password you’ve been assigned (e.g. `{{ USER_ID }}/{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`):

image::che-login.png[cdw, 700]

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on your personal dashboard. Click on the name of the pre-created workspace on the left, as shown below (the name will be different depending on your assigned number). You can also click on the name of the workspace in the center, and then click on the green button that says _Open_ on the top right hand side of the screen.

After a minute or two, you’ll be placed in the workspace:

image::che-workspace.png[cdw, 900]

This IDE is based on Eclipse Che (which is in turn based on MicroSoft VS Code editor).

You can see icons on the left for navigating between project explorer, search, version control (e.g. Git), debugging, and other plugins.  You’ll use these during the course of this workshop. Feel free to click on them and see what they do:

image::crw-icons.png[cdw, 400]

[NOTE]
====
If things get weird or your browser appears, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.
====

Many features of CodeReady Workspaces are accessed via *Commands*. You can see a few of the commands listed with links on the home page (e.g. _New File.._, _Git Clone.._, and others).

If you ever need to run commands that you don't see in a menu, you can press kbd:[F1] to open the command window, or the more traditional kbd:[Control+SHIFT+P] (or kbd:[Command+SHIFT+P] on Mac OS X).

==== Import Projects

Let's import the project source code for this lab. Click on **Git Clone..** (or type kbd:[F1], enter 'git' and click on the auto-completed _Git Clone.._ )

image::che-workspace-gitclone.png[cdw, 900]

Step through the prompts, using the following value for **Repository URL**. If you use *FireFox*, it may end up pasting extra spaces at the end, so just press backspace after pasting:

[source,none,role="copypaste"]
----
https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs.git
----

image::crw-clone-repo.png[crw,900]

Next, select `/projects` in the drop-down menu for destination directory:

image::crw-clone-dest.png[crw,900]

And click *Select Repository Location*.

Once imported, choose **Add to workspace** when prompted in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

The project is imported into your workspace and is visible in the project explorer:

image::crw-clone-explorer.png[crw,900]

==== IMPORTANT: Check out proper Git branch

To make sure you're using the right version of the project files, run this command in a CodeReady Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cd $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs && git checkout ocp-4.3
----

[NOTE]
====
The Terminal window in CodeReady Workspaces. You can open a terminal window for any of the containers running in your Developer workspace. For the rest of these labs, anytime you need to run a command in a terminal, you can use the **>_ New Terminal** command on the right:
====

=== Remove other projects

If you've completed other modules today (such as `cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs`), remove them from your workspace by right-clicking on the project name in the explorer and choose *Remove from Workspace* and accept the warning. Be sure not to delete the new project you just imported for this lab!

image::remove-workspace.png[remove, 700]

=== Login to OpenShift CLI

Although your Eclipse Che workspace is running on the Kubernetes cluster, it’s running with a default restricted _Service Account_ that prevents you from creating most resource types. If you’ve completed other modules, you’re probably already logged in, but let’s login again: open a Terminal and issue the following command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc login https://$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST:$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
----

Enter your username and password assigned to you:

* Username: `{{ USER_ID }}`
* Password: `{{ OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD }}`

You should see something like this (the project names may be different):

[source,none]
----
Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * istio-system
    knative-serving
    user6-bookinfo
    user6-catalog
    user6-cloudnative-pipeline
    user6-cloudnativeapps
    user6-inventory

Using project "istio-system".
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
----

==== Do this if this is the first module you're doing today, otherwise continue to the Verifying the Dev Environment!

These commands reset and re-play all the steps from module 1 and should take 4-5 minutes to finish.

[WARNING]
====
*You do not need to run these if you already completed the Optimizing Existing Applications lab and have created `catalog` and `inventory` and the CoolStore `monolith` projects!*
====

[source, sh, role="copypaste"]
----
sh /projects/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs/monolith/scripts/deploy-inventory.sh {{ USER_ID }} && \
sh /projects/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs/monolith/scripts/deploy-catalog.sh {{ USER_ID }} && \
sh /projects/cloud-native-workshop-v2m2-labs/monolith/scripts/deploy-coolstore.sh {{ USER_ID }}
----

Wait for the commands to complete. If you see any errors, contact an instructor!

=== Verifying the Dev Environment

In the previous module, you created a new OpenShift project called *{{ USER_ID }}-coolstore-dev* which represents your developer personal
project in which you deployed the CoolStore monolith.

==== Verify Application

Let’s take a moment and review the OpenShift resources that are created for the Monolith:

* Build Config: *coolstore* build config is the configuration for building the Monolith image from the source code or WAR file.
* Image Stream: *coolstore* image stream is the virtual view of all coolstore container images built and pushed to the OpenShift integrated registry.
* Deployment Config: *coolstore* deployment config deploys and redeploys the Coolstore container image whenever a new coolstore container image becomes available. Similarly, the *coolstore-postgresql* does the same for the database.
* Service: *coolstore* and *coolstore-postgresql* service is an internal load balancer which identifies a set of pods (containers) in order to proxy the connections it receives to them. Anything that depends on the service can to refer to it at a consistent address (service name or IP).
* Route: *www* route registers the service on the built-in external load-balancer and assigns a public DNS name to it so that it can be reached from outside OpenShift cluster.

[NOTE]
====
When referring to Kubernetes or OpenShift object types in `oc` commands, you can use short synonyms for long words, like *bc* instead of *buildconfig*, *is* for *imagestream*, *dc* for *deploymentconfig*, *svc* for *service*, etc.

Don’t worry about reading and understanding the output of oc describe. Just make sure the command doesn’t report errors!
====

Run these commands to inspect the elements via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal window:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc project {{ USER_ID }}-coolstore-dev && \
oc get bc coolstore && \
oc get is coolstore && \
oc get dc coolstore && \
oc get svc coolstore && \
oc describe route www
----

You should get a valid value for each, and no errors!

Visit the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-coolstore-dev[Topology View^] to see the coolstore app (and its database). The *Topology* view in the _Developer_ perspective of the OpenShift web console provides a visual representation of all the applications within a project, their build status, and the components and services associated with them. You'll visit this often:

image::coolstore-dev-topology.png[crw,700]

Verify that you can access the monolith by clicking on the route link (the arrow) to access the running monolith:

image::route_link.png[route_link]

The coolstore web interface should look like:

image::coolstore_web.png[route_link, 600]


=== Verify Database

You can log into the running Postgres container using the following via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal window:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc rsh dc/coolstore-postgresql
----

Once logged in, use the following command to execute an SQL statement to show some content from the database and then exit:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
psql -U $POSTGRESQL_USER $POSTGRESQL_DATABASE -c 'select name,price from PRODUCT_CATALOG;' | cat; exit
----

You should see the following:

----
          name          | price
------------------------+-------
 Red Fedora             | 34.99
 Forge Laptop Sticker   |   8.5
 Solid Performance Polo |  17.8
 Ogio Caliber Polo      | 28.75
 16 oz. Vortex Tumbler  |     6
 Pebble Smart Watch     |    24
 Oculus Rift            |   106
 Lytro Camera           |  44.3
 Atari 2600 Joystick    |   240
(9 rows)
----

This shows the content of the monolith's database.

With our running project on OpenShift, in the next step we’ll explore how you as a developer can work with the running app to make changes and debug the application!
